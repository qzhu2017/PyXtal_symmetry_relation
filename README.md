# Group-subgroup symmetry relation applied to phase transition

This is a public repository to explain the work in [Symmetry Relation Database and Its Application to Ferroelectric Materials Discovery, Zhu, et al, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10655)

## Dataset (in ase.database format)
- `All_mp_2022.db`: all identified structure pairs in by [Zhu, et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10655)
- `Smidt_2020.db`: all identified structure pairs in by [Smidt, et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0407-9)

## Tutorial
- [Demo.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/qzhu2017/PyXtal_symmetry_relation/blob/main/Demo.ipynb): a tutorial to explain the concepts of symmetry relation and the relevant tools in PyXtal for the automated analysis of symmetry relation. 

To run the tutorial, it is required to to install [PyXtal](https://github.com/qzhu2017/PyXtal) via `pip install pyxtal`.

## Figures
The related scripts to plot the figures in [Zhu, et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10655).
